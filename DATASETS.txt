The dataset that we are using encompasses information about the restaurant menus around the New York area. This includes information like the amount of times a food is written on a menu and how many pages a menu length is. I've noticed that coffee and tea are one of the most popular items on the menu and they are beverages so that makes a lot of sense. Drinks and snacks tend to be included the most since they are typically ordered by each person.
