The data described shows the data on vaccinations occuring throughout the US that include the patient's general information, type of vaccination, and symptons from post-vaccination. 
We want to determine the effectiveness of vaccines based on severity of symptons as well as determining other secondary factors that might affect the patients symptons including: age, gender, location, and ethnicity. 
We can also extrapolate the data and determine which demographic receives more vaccination than the others.
